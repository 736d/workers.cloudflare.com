# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Built with Workers repo!

We're still getting this repo up-and-running from an open-source perspective, so here's some info about this repo, what kind of contributions we're looking for, etc.

## Codebase

We're generally _not_ looking for code contributions to Built with Workers â€“ because there are a lot of moving parts, as well as developers/designers who need to review every PR incoming to the project, we are unable to accept HTML/CSS/JS contributions to the site.

## Content

If you find that there's content issues with the site (such as broken links, typos, etc), we'd love your contributions! Note that because the content is driven by [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io), a headless CMS provider, a member of the Cloudflare Workers team will need to manage the update to the content. Please open an issue detailing the incorrect content and we'll get it fixed ASAP!
